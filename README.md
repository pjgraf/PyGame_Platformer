# PyGame_Platformer

This is a platformer/sidescroller syle game, written in my free time using python and the pygame library. 

LEFT/A, UP/W, RIGHT/D, SPACE translates to MOVE LEFT, JUMP, MOVE RIGHT, SHOOT respectively.

Mostly, this was a learning experience and an attempt to grow proficient in pygame. There are some minor quirks (features) here and there, but overall a fun project. 
I will be coming back to this project to add animation for the character's slingshot and make adjustments to the collision between the character's feet and sprite's head.

I hope anyone taking the time to look at this project will perhaps find it interesting, or learn something, or teach me something. Please leave any critiques you may have!
