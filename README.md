# PyGame_Platformer

This is a platformer/sidescroller syle game, written in my free time using python and the pygame library. 

LEFT/A, UP/W, RIGHT/D, SPACE translates to MOVE LEFT, JUMP, MOVE RIGHT, SHOOT respectively.

This game was created stricly for educational purposes in an attempt to grow proficient in pygame. There are some minor quirks (features) here and there, but overall a fun project. I will be coming back to this project to add animation for the character's slingshot and make adjustments to the collision between the character's feet and sprite's head.

I hope anyone taking the time to look at this project will perhaps find it interesting, or learn something, or teach me something. Please leave any critiques you may have!


I did not create any assets seen in this game. All assets used, from sprites to tiles, have been created by people other than myself. The original creators of these assets posted them online and included written consent for use.
